# Affective-Computing

To run the study:

1. open a command prompt or powershell window in the file, and type: python blink_detector_face_orientation.py
2. the blink application should start running
3. open the untitled.psyexp file and once the Psycopy window is open, click on the play button to run the experiment
4. at the end we get 2 files:
     - one called "test-new" where we'll find the data collected from the blink detector
     - one inside the "data" file where we'll find the data collected from the psycopy application
