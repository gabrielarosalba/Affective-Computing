# Affective-Computing

To run the study:

1. open a command prompt or powershell window in the file, and type: python blink_detector_face_orientation.py
2. the blink application should start running
3. open the Finalfile.psyrun by double clicking on it and run the sequence
4. at the end we get 2 files:
     - one called "test-new" where we'll find the data collected from the blink detector
     - one inside the "data" file where we'll find the data collected from the psycopy application
